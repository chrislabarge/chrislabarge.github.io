My name is Chris LaBarge.  I am a 26 year old hardcore musician who realized the music scene is not a great field to 
make an honest living anymore. So in the summer of 2013 I decided to pursue coding.  I had
experience with computers from an early age but never actually got into the nitty gritty of computers
until recent.  

I started with learning Ruby and now am full able to make 100% Responsive Websites
with the help of Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap.  I am now in the process of trying to switch over from
working full time as a "Burrito-Roller" (been working at a burrito bar for 4 years ) to doing free-lance
web development (to build a resume) and hopefully landing a kick ass job.
