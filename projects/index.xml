      <description>This is a simple words per minute typing calculator. I built it using the Volt framework, which specializes in running your Ruby code on the CLIENT as well as the server. I did not write a single line of Javascript, as Volt uses the Opal gem to compile your Ruby code to javascript. You can read about how I made this simple app here .</description>

      <description>This is redesign I did for a local User-Group of Ruby programmers. It was already using github pages for hosting so there was no need to mess with the back-end, I simply updated the bootstrap and took advantage of the responsive grid.</description>
