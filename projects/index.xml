      <description>This is a e-commerce project I did for a client that wanted to have a website based around her Etsy store.
I wanted to get a little creative with this one so I decided to build my own tools in order to sync the Etsy shop with the website. Basically, I did not want the client to have to upload new content to both her Etsy shop and website. It would be easier for her and future clients to just be able to add a new product to their Etsy shop and have it automatically show up on the website.</description>

      <description>MenuBerry is resource for vegans to discover food options at restaurants.
I have been building MenuBerry part-time for the last year or so. It started as a hobby project that eventually grew over time. It is still in the early days, but it&amp;rsquo;s fully functional. Visitors can utilize the application as a resource to find restaurants and vegan options. Registered users are allowed to and contribute content and receive updates about their favorite restaurants.</description>

      <description>This is a simple words per minute typing calculator. I built it using the Volt framework, which specializes in running your Ruby code on the CLIENT as well as the server. I did not write a single line of Javascript, as Volt uses the Opal gem to compile your Ruby code to javascript. You can read about how I made this simple app here .</description>

      <description>This is redesign I did for a local User-Group of Ruby programmers. It was already using github pages for hosting so there was no need to mess with the back-end, I simply updated the bootstrap and took advantage of the responsive grid.</description>
