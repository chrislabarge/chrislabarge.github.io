      <description>MenuBerry is resource for vegans to discover food options at restaurants.
I have been building MenuBerry part-time for the last year or so. It started as a hobby project that eventually grew over time. It is still in the early days, but it&amp;rsquo;s fully functional. Visitors can utilize the application as a resource to find restaurants and vegan options. Registered users are allowed to and contribute content and receive updates about their favorite restaurants.</description>

      <description>This is a project I did for a client that needed an online presence for his roofing business. I built him a static website using the GOlang Hugo generator, and hosted it on github pages. I than integrated it with Forestry.io to allow for a CMS like expeprience. He can now update content on the fly without having to pay a monthly fee.</description>

      <description>This is a simple words per minute typing calculator. I built it using the Volt framework, which specializes in running your Ruby code on the CLIENT as well as the server. I did not write a single line of Javascript, as Volt uses the Opal gem to compile your Ruby code to javascript. You can read about how I made this simple app here .</description>

      <description>This is redesign I did for a local User-Group of Ruby programmers. It was already using github pages for hosting so there was no need to mess with the back-end, I simply updated the bootstrap and took advantage of the responsive grid.</description>
