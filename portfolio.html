        	This is responsive marketing website I built and designed for a saftey
        	company based out of Clifton Park, NY. I made it with Ruby on Rails, 
        	making it scalable giving myself or future developers the ability to add on 
        	features.

        	This is redesign I did for a local User-Group of Ruby programmers.  It
        	was already using github pages for hosting so there was no need to
        	mess with the back-end, I simply updated the bootstrap and took 
        	advantage of the responsive grid.

        <p class="lead">
        	This is a simple words per minute typing calculator.  It was built using
        	the Volt framework, which specializes in running your Ruby code on the
        	CLIENT as well as the server.  No Javascript was needed for this app
        	as Volt uses the Opal gem to compile your Ruby code to javascript.
