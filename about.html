				<h1>About Me</h1>		
				<p class="lead">
					My name is Chris LaBarge.  I am a 27 year-old developer living in Albany, New York. 
					Although I have been interacting with computers sense I was 6 years old,
					and coding HTML in highschool, I only began programming 2 years ago with Ruby.  
					<br><br>
					I absolutley love the Ruby community and all of the fantastic 
					resources that are available.
					<br><br>
					I made this site to use as a blog and portfolio. I am currently looking
					for free-lance work and/or a junior level position in the field.		
					
					<br><br>
					As far as hobbies, I enjoy film, photography, playing guitar and have been in and out of rock bands
					sense I was 15. 
					Recently, <a href="https://instagram.com/p/yYjl6LkpUd/">I began playing around with the Raspberry Pi</a> and was introduced to the world of hardware.
					<br><br>
					I am constantly looking for new people to interact with and learn from,
				  so please feel free to contact me.  Any fellow
				  developers looking to Pair-Program, lets team up and make something 
				  cool!
