				<h1>About Me</h1>		
				<p class="lead">
					My name is Chris LaBarge.  I am a 27 year-old developer living in Albany, New York. 
					I have been interacting with computers sense I was 6 years old.
					Besides coding the HTML for my LiveJournal and Myspace profiles in highschool, 
					I began programming with Ruby 2 years ago.  
					<br><br>
					I love absolutley love the Ruby community and all of the fantastic 
					resources that are available.
					<br><br>
					I made this site to use as a blog and portfolio. I am currently looking
					for free-lance work and/or a junior level position in the field.
					
					Although my blog will have a strong technology focus, I will also be trying
					to write non-technical posts. 
					
					<br><br>
					As far as hobbies, I enjoy playing guitar and have been in and out of rock bands
					sense I was 15. I also love nerding out on movies/television.
					Recently I began playing around with the Raspberry Pi and was introduced to the world of hardware.
					<br><br>
					I am constantly looking for new people to interact with and learn from,
				  so please feel free to contact me and pick me my brain.  Any fellow
				  developers looking to Pair-Program, lets pair up and make something 
				  cool!
