##Overview
The [Code Newbie](http://www.codenewbie.org) website and community is a priceless tool for beginners.  It 
offers several resources to help you along your programming journey.

My favorite of it's resources are the podcasts.  The interviewer and 
founder of Code Newbie, [Saron Yitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek), does
an absolutley fantastic job at keeping the podcast organic as well as informative.

There are a lot of podcasts I listen to, that forget that not all listeners can
keep up with pacing and terminology.  Saron does a tremendous job of having
herself and guests re-clarify  things when they start to get abstract. Even the
tone of her voice is very calm and reassuring which I think rubs off on the guests
and allows them to be very natural during the interview. 


##Subject Matter
The shows them selves each feature one guest and range from subjects like... 

- [Getting a job in the field](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/autotune-inclusivity-and-getting-a-job)
- [Speaking in front of an audience](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/ep-5-speaking-of-speaking)
- [Mother Coders](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/mother-coders)
- [Accessibility](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/accessibility)

This month Code Newbie is teaming up with another one of my favorite podcasts
[Hansel Minutes](http://hanselminutes.com/) and doing March is for Makers.  Each
podcasts in the month of March involve hardware, and both shows have had really
good content so far.

##Bottom Line
You do not have to be a beginner to appreciate all of the amazing things
[Code Newbie](http://www.codenewbie.org) has to  offer. Go head over to the 
website now and become part of a wonderful community.
