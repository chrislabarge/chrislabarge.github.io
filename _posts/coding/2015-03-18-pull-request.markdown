##Overview
About a month ago I was searching for a local user-group of Ruby programmers, 
and luckily came across the Tech Valley Ruby Brigade. Even more lucky, their 
website needed a modern design update and they provided the repository on github 
for anyone to grab.  

It was a perfect opportunity for me to learn how to submit a pull-request and at
the same time a good ice-breaker for the first time I would attend the user-group 
meetup.  

##Things You Will Learn
Through my experience I will go over how to.....

- Fork a repository
- Clone a repository
- Commit and push new branch with changes
- Submit a Pull-Request

 
###1. Fork the repository
I went to the github repository for the website that I wanted to work on. Once
there, I clicked the "Fork" button in the top right corner.

This copies the entire repository of the website right onto my personal github
account.

###2. Clone the repository

Next I had to clone the forked repository from my github account to my local
machine. By going to terminal and entering the following command.
{% highlight bash %}
	chrislabarge$ git clone https://github.com/chrislabarge/techvalleyrb.github.com.git
{% endhighlight %}

You can get the url path of the above command from the forked repository on your 
github account by copying from and pasting into the command-line.

###3. Create a new branch

Once I had the repository cloned onto my machine, I created a new branch
from the master and named it "updating-bootstrap". Creating a new required in 
order to make changes.

{%highlight bash%}
	chrislabarge$ git checkout -b updating-bootstrap
{%endhighlight%}

At this point I was able to start making changes. I updated the css bootstrap 
framework for the website and took advantage of the responsive grid design.  

####Note 
*Normally you would not want  want to perform any MAJOR adjustments on your contribution*

###4. Add and commit any changes
Once I was satisfied with my changes, I added all of the newly changed files...
{%highlight bash%}
	chrislabarge$ git add -A 
{%endhighlight%}

And then made a commit.

{%highlight bash%}
	chrislabarge$ git commit -m "updated the bootstrap version and put the content into grid format" 
{%endhighlight%}

###5. Push the branch to Github
After I made the commit, it was time to push the branch up to my github.

{%highlight bash%}
	chrislabarge$ git push origin updating-bootstrap 
{%endhighlight%}

###6. Final- Submit a Pull-Request
It was finally time to show off my changes and submit a pull-request.  I went back
to the original repository of the website, the one I went to in step 1. And
clicked the green button below.

Next, I selected my branch to compare, (updating-bootstrap) and clicked 
"Create pull request".
(The compare branch in the photo below says testing, it should be updating-bootstrap.)
