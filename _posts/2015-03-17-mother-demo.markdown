##Overview

On December 9th, 1968, Dr. Engelbart presented what is known as "The Mother of All Demos".
This 10-part video highlight of the computer demonstration is an absolute must see for 
both developers and users alike. 

  
At the time, the computer technology shown was not known to the general public
at all, so the audience was literally witnessing magic. It absolutely mind 
boggling how many innovative ideas are all crammed into this 90-minute demo.
 
###Technology Covered

- Computer Mouse
- Windows
- Word Processing
- Video Conferencing
- Screen Sharing
- Hypertext
- Version Control
- And more..

The amount of modern day computer tech in this video that is just now being utlized by the 
general public is astonishing.  I had heard about this video on a couple different podcasts 
but was not expecting to be so impressed. We are talking about close to a half
a century ago this stuff was fully realized by genius's who were able
to get it all on one operating system even with the hardware limitations they had.

There is also some tech that never found it's way to the mainstream such as a
piece of hardware Dr. Engelbart uses with his left hand.  it is a 5-key board 
that has 31 combinations of pressing with your fingers, that acts has a modern 
key-board substitute. It looks difficult.

###If You're a Developer
You will especially appreciate the To-Do list.
