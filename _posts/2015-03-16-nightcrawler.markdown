##Review

This Dan Gilroy film (director and writer) starring Jake Gyllenhaal was the 
the first film I saw this year, and I couldn't have been more pleased.   


Not only
is the acting, music and cinemtoraphy top notch but it gives an extraordinarly 
intimate view local news media. 
 Which in my opinion is a very fascinating subject given thats almost everyone
 consumes it but no one knows exactly how and why it is produced that way it is. 
 If you are familiar with the teleivision show the Wire, each season focus's on
 a different part of the city of Batlimore.  My favorite season was season 5(LOOK
 UP WHAT SEASON)  which focused on the local newspaper, and in particular, what
 stories made it to print.  

This film follows that season's same type of news trasparency but instead, on
the ground floor of a  Los Angeles tv newsroom.  As Wire fans might guess, it is 
all about ratings, bottom line. Morals and integraty gets thrown out the windows 
when it boils down to numbers.
