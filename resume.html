				<h1>Overview</h1>		
				<p class="lead">
					I've been learning to program for 2 years now.  I have a year of experience with 
					Ruby on Rails and making web apps as well as static websites. With my 
					last couple of projects, I have been spending a good deal of time with 
					responsive front-end grid design.  Using mostly Bootstrap I have really 
					been getting a hang of front-end development and am now in the process 
					of learning more back-end.
					<br><br>
					I am <b>trust worthy</b>, <b>hard working</b>, and although I have only recently been with the tech
					field, I have been a manager for 7+ years in the food-service industry.  I know how to 
					interact and deal with employees as well as customers.
					<br></br>
					I can pick up and learn new techniques very fast and become an asset by providing
					high end results for any task handed to me.

<p class="lead">
This is redesign I did for a local User-Group of Ruby programmers. It
was already using github pages for hosting so there was no need to
mess with the back-end, I simply updated the bootstrap and took
advantage of the responsive grid.

<p class="lead">
This is a simple words per minute typing calculator. It was built using
the Volt framework, which specializes in running your Ruby code on the
CLIENT as well as the server. No Javascript was needed for this app
as Volt uses the Opal gem to compile your Ruby code to javascript.
